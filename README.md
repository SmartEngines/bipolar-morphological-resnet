# bipolar-morphological-resnet

This is TensorFlow code for experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 bipolar morphological ResNet-like neural network.

mnist_morph.py - the main file for MNIST experiment

cifar10_morph.py - the main file for CIFAR-10 experiment

BipolarMorphologicalConv2D.py - the file with bipolar morphological convolutional layer implementation

resnet.py - the file with BM-ResNet network implementation

utils.py - the file with helper functions

The implementation of ResNet network is based on the code from Keras https://keras.io/examples/cifar10_resnet/
